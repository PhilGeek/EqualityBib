# Introduction #

A bibliography of relatively recent philosophical papers on equality compiled principally by Véronique Munoz-Dardé. 

The bibliography will be maintained separately from [Philosophy.bib](http://philgeek.github.com/bib/), though it will be merged into Philosophy.bib.

The bibliography is a [BibTeX](http://www.bibtex.org/) file created using [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/).

See this [blog post](http://markelikalderon.com/blog/2008/06/17/gitting-bibtex/) for the rationale for keeping a BibTeX file in an open Git repository.
